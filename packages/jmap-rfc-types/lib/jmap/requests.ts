   * As described later in this specification, some records may have a
   * property that contains the id of another record.  To allow more
   * efficient network usage, you can set this property to reference a
   * record created earlier in the same API request.  Since the real id
   * is unknown when the request is created, the client can instead
   * specify the creation id it assigned, prefixed with a "#" (see
   * Section 5.3 for more details).
   *
   * As the server processes API requests, any time it successfully
   * creates a new record, it adds the creation id to this map (see the
   * "create" argument to /set in Section 5.3), with the server-
   * assigned real id as the value.  If it comes across a reference to
   * a creation id in a create/update, it looks it up in the map and
   * replaces the reference with the real id, if found.
   *
   * The client can pass an initial value for this map as the
   * `createdIds` property of the Request object.  This may be an empty
   * object.  If given in the request, the response will also include a
   * createdIds property.  This allows proxy servers to easily split a
   * JMAP request into multiple JMAP requests to send to different
   * servers.  For example, it could send the first two method calls to
   * server A, then the third to server B, before sending the fourth to
   * server A again.  By passing the createdIds of the previous
   * response to the next request, it can ensure all of these still
   * resolve.  See Section 5.8 for further discussion of proxy
   * considerations.

 * result reference should be resolved and the value used as the "real"
 * argument.  The method is then processed as normal.  If any result
 * reference fails to resolve, the whole method MUST be rejected with an
 * `invalidResultReference` error.  If an arguments object contains the
 * same argument name in normal and referenced form (e.g., `foo` and
